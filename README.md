## Hi y'all 👋🏽 I'm Isa!

- 🧠 I'm currently taking a break for my mental health. 
- ✨ When I'm better, I will resume being a Hackathon Coach for Major League Hacking as well as finish my Computer Science degree from Hunter College. 
- 📜 In the past, I've worked as a SWE intern for Microsoft, a PM intern for Roblox, a SWE intern for Oden Technologies, a web dev intern for Caribou Health, and more.
- 🌱 I'm working on a mental health-related project and learning everything from product management to backend development to marketing.
- 👯 I'm looking for collaborators for this project! I'll need most skillsets, technical and design and business and medical, so my main ask is that you understand the importance of mental health and removing the stigma around mental illness.
